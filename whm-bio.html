<div style="font-family: 'Exo 2', sans-serif;"><h3>ABOUT WHM</h3></div>

<div style="font-family: 'Antic Slab', serif;"><p>Hello. I’m William Henry Morris*. I read, write and edit fiction. My primary interests are literary fiction — especially the 19th and early 20th century novel and novella and the 20th/21st century short story — and speculative fiction — especially high fantasy, urban fantasy, the weird, space opera, and far future sci-fi (dying earth). And I like my speculative fiction to skew literary and my literary fiction to not shy away from the fantastical.</p>

<p>I’m also a huge fan of humor in fiction, including the obvious: Wodehouse, Pratchett, etc.</p>

<p>For what I’ve read in the past few years, see my <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5311981.Wm_Henry_Morris">Goodreads profile</a>. Major favorites include: Franz Kafka, Bulgakov, Leo Tolstoy, Lois McMaster Bujold, Karen Russell, Anita Brookner, Henry James, Robin Hobb, Gabriel Josipovici, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Jane Austen, Ursula K. Le Guin, John Donne, Karen Joy Fowler, Daniel Abraham, George R.R. Martin, Gene Wolfe, Octavia Butler, and William Blake.</p>

<p>I currently live in the Twin Cities (Minnesota) with my wife and daughter and work in higher education marketing and public relations. I graduated from UC Berkeley with a bachelor’s degree in English literature and from San Francisco State University with a master’s degree in comparative literature.</p>

<p>*Or Wm Henry Morris. Or simply WHM.</p>
